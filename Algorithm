**********************************NOTE BELOW********************************************
I want my program to extend ArraySet. ArraySet also implements the interface MySet<E>
The methods in ArraySet require parameters of type MySet, so because I want to use these methods
I am creating sets of type MySet in my program. Is this right? I put stars on the line below because I do not
know if that is what I am supposed to put at the beginning of my program

*******This class should extend ArraySet (public class AliceSpellCheckHW<E> extends ArraySet)
Create a fileReader, reader, that will read the file "Alice30h.txt"
Create another fileReader, readerSpell, that will read the file "Unabr1U.txt"
Create a fileWriter, w, that will write to the file "Misspelled.txt"
Create a printWriter, writer, that will use the fileWriter to write to the file "Misspelled.txt"

Algorithm:

Read the entire file, "Alice30h.txt", into a string, aliceS
Use string tokenizer to separate the string into words at every space " "
	print each element created from this into MySet (alice)
	because I want to be able to analyze the elements in this set
	and when using the methods from the ArraySet class, the parameters are of type MySet
Read the entire file, "Unabr1U.txt", line by line
	Each line will be read into a string, s
	Each string, s, will be added as a new element to the set MySet correct
	because I want to be able to compare the elements in this set with the elements in alice
	so the two sets should be of the same type
Create a MySet (misspelled) to print misspelled words to
	Once this set is complete, it will be printed to the file "Misspelled.txt"

Remove all punctutation in alice (any character that is not 'a-z' or a space) since the dictionary does not contain any punctuation
Separate (split) the words at spaces to create separate elements
Convert all the letters in the entire set (alice) to lower case

Find the difference of alice and correct (alice - correct) using the difference method from ArraySet class
	because this will return a new copy of type MySet with all of the elements in "alice" that are not in "correct"
	These elements will be all of the misspelled words
Catch this returned MySet<E> into a new variable (MySet<E> difference)
	All of these elements in (difference) will be those spelled incorrectly
	These are the elements that I want to print to the file "Misspelled.txt"
For each element in (difference),
	Check to see if the element from (difference) exists in MySet<E> (misspelled) (Use the contains method in ArraySet)
	Call the contains method in ArraySet and send it the element as the parameter
	If the element exists in MySet<E> (misspelled) (returns true)
		do not print the element to MySet<E> (misspelled)
		because we only want one copy of each misspelled word in this set
	If the element does not exist in MySet<E> (misspelled) (returns false)
		print element to MySet<E> (misspelled)
		because we need to make sure one copy of this element exists in this set
After all the elements are accounted for, print the entire (misspelled) set to the file Misspelled.txt
This file will now have one copy of all of the misspelled words from the original file Alice30h.txt
